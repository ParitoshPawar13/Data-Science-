📊 Customer & Sales Data Analysis Project
🚀 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct a multi-faceted analysis of customer and sales data in order to:

Identify high-value customer segments

Forecast future sales trends

Predict customer churn

Recommend strategic actions to improve revenue growth and retention

This end-to-end data science pipeline combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, time-series forecasting, predictive modeling, and business strategy recommendations.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes customer details, product information, and transaction records.

Customer Details: ID, Name, Age, Gender, Income Level, Loyalty Score, Customer Segment, Location

Product Information: Product ID, Category, Sub-category, Brand, Cost Price, Selling Price, Discount Offered

Transaction Details: Purchase Quantity, Unit Price, Discount, Payment Method, Date of Purchase, Sales Channel, Payment Status

(Dataset sourced from platforms like Kaggle / UCI Repository or proprietary data.)

🔧 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values using Iterative Imputer, KNN Imputer, and MICE

Detected and treated outliers with Tukey’s Method & Robust Z-score

Normalized/Standardized numerical features

Engineered new features:

Average Purchase Frequency

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Recency Score

Loyalty Score

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified trends in purchasing behavior by Time of Day, Day of Week, Month, and Year

Analyzed demographics (Age, Gender, Income)

Investigated impact of discounts and product category performance

Built correlation matrices for feature relationships

Applied STL Decomposition for seasonality analysis

3️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Implemented Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) & Agglomerative Clustering

Performed RFM Analysis enhanced with Loyalty Score, Discount Utilization, and Payment Preference

Built detailed customer profiles

Suggested targeted marketing strategies for each segment

4️⃣ Sales Forecasting

Built Seasonal ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models

Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE

Forecasted sales peaks & dips with strategic recommendations

5️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction

Developed churn models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Optimized hyperparameters with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV

Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall Curve

Provided early-warning churn indicators

6️⃣ Product Analysis & Cross-Selling

Conducted Market Basket Analysis (Apriori, FP-Growth)

Identified cross-selling & bundling opportunities

Analyzed profitability based on cost, price, and discount

Recommended promotions & bundling strategies

7️⃣ Reporting & Visualization

Interactive dashboards using Plotly & Seaborn
